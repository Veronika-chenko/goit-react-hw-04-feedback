# Feedback Widget

Feedback Widget is an application to collect statistics. 

There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral and bad. In addition, the total number of collected
reviews from all categories and the percentage of positive reviews are implemented.


*The review statistics are not saved between different sessions.
